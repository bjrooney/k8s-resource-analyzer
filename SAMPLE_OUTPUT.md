---

## 2. Critical Issues (Top 5)

### Issue #1: Missing Resource Requests and Limits

**Priority**: 1 (1=Highest)

**Description**: 125 containers are missing resource requests or limits

**Impact**: Prevents proper scheduling, impacts Velero backups, and can cause cluster instability

**Recommendation**:

Set resource requests and limits for all containers based on observed usage patterns

**Examples**:

- `asu/payment-service-7d9f8b5c4-x7n2m (container: app)`
- `cgh/flight-tracker-58b7d6-qw9p8 (container: tracker)`
- `jfk/baggage-handler-95f7c-k4m2n (container: handler)`

**Action Items**:

1. Audit all pods using: `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.spec.containers[].resources.requests == null)'`
2. Implement LimitRange in each namespace
3. Update deployment manifests with appropriate resource values
4. Use Vertical Pod Autoscaler to recommend resource values

---

### Issue #2: OOMKilled Events Detected

**Priority**: 2 (1=Highest)

**Description**: 8 OOMKilled events found in recent history

**Impact**: Workload disruptions, data loss, and degraded application performance

**Recommendation**:

Increase memory limits for affected pods or optimize application memory usage

**Examples**:

- `asu/payment-processor-6c8d9-z2x4v at 2025-10-27T09:45:23Z`
- `cgh/analytics-worker-84f6c-h5n9m at 2025-10-27T08:12:15Z`
- `jfk/data-sync-job-92d5f-p7k3w at 2025-10-27T07:33:47Z`

**Action Items**:

1. Identify affected pods from the events list
2. Increase memory limits by 50-100% initially
3. Monitor memory usage patterns using metrics server or Prometheus
4. Investigate potential memory leaks in applications

---

## 3. Resource Management Analysis

### Missing Resource Requests and Limits

- **Missing Both**: 89 containers
- **Missing Requests Only**: 21 containers
- **Missing Limits Only**: 15 containers

### Impact on Cluster Operations

**Velero Backups**:
- Pods without resource requests may not be properly backed up
- Restore operations may fail due to resource allocation issues
- Recommendation: Set resource requests to ensure Velero can calculate backup requirements

**System Pods**:
- System pods may be evicted when resource-constrained workloads consume all node resources
- Can lead to cluster instability and monitoring gaps
- Recommendation: Implement ResourceQuota and LimitRange policies

**Cluster Stability**:
- Without requests, scheduler cannot make informed placement decisions
- Without limits, pods can consume excessive resources and impact neighbors
- May trigger cascading failures during traffic spikes

### Short-Lived Jobs Impact

- **Total Jobs**: 45
- **Short Jobs (<2 min)**: 32
- **Percentage**: 71.1%

**Impact**: High frequency of short-lived jobs can:
- Create scheduling churn and API server load
- Complicate resource capacity planning
- Impact cluster autoscaler effectiveness

**Recommendations**:
- Consider batching short jobs or using longer-running workers with queue patterns
- Set appropriate resource requests to prevent over-provisioning
- Implement job cleanup policies to prevent accumulation

### Recommended Resource Allocation Strategy

```yaml
# Example resource configuration
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"  # Based on observed baseline usage
    cpu: "100m"      # 0.1 CPU cores
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"  # 2x requests for burst capacity
    cpu: "500m"      # Allow bursting up to 0.5 cores
```

## 4. Node Analysis

### Nodes with High Resource Utilization

| Node Name | Issue | CPU Requested | Memory Requested | CPU Allocatable | Memory Allocatable |
|-----------|-------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| aks-pool1-34567890-vmss000001 | High CPU requests | 7.20 cores | 24.50 GB | 8.00 cores | 28.00 GB |
| aks-pool1-34567890-vmss000003 | High memory requests | 5.80 cores | 23.20 GB | 8.00 cores | 28.00 GB |
| aks-pool2-34567890-vmss000000 | High CPU requests | 7.50 cores | 22.10 GB | 8.00 cores | 28.00 GB |

### Recommendations

1. **Node Pool Balancing**:
   - Review node pool sizing and consider adding nodes
   - Implement pod anti-affinity to spread workloads
   - Consider node taints/tolerations for workload isolation

2. **Autoscaling Configuration**:
   ```yaml
   # Cluster Autoscaler Settings
   scaleDownUtilizationThreshold: 0.65
   scaleDownDelayAfterAdd: 10m
   scaleDownUnneededTime: 10m
   maxNodeProvisionTime: 15m
   ```

3. **Pod Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use PodTopologySpreadConstraints for even distribution
   - Set appropriate resource requests to enable efficient packing
   - Review and optimize large workloads that may be causing imbalance

### OOMKilled Events

Found 8 OOMKilled events:

| Timestamp | Namespace | Pod | Container | Node |
|-----------|-----------|-----|-----------|------|
| 2025-10-27 09:45:23 | asu | payment-processor-6c8d9-z2x4v | processor | aks-pool1-vmss000001 |
| 2025-10-27 08:12:15 | cgh | analytics-worker-84f6c-h5n9m | worker | aks-pool1-vmss000003 |
| 2025-10-27 07:33:47 | jfk | data-sync-job-92d5f-p7k3w | sync | aks-pool2-vmss000000 |

**Action Required**:
- Increase memory limits for affected pods
- Investigate application memory leaks
- Consider implementing memory profiling

## 5. RabbitMQ Stability Analysis

**RabbitMQ Pods Found**: 3

- `messaging/rabbitmq-server-0`
- `messaging/rabbitmq-server-1`
- `messaging/rabbitmq-server-2`

### Current Configuration

- ‚úì Priority Class Configured: false
- ‚úì Resource Limits Set: true

### Recommendations for Maximum Stability

#### 1. Create High-Priority PriorityClass

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq-critical
value: 1000000  # Higher than system-cluster-critical (2000000000 reserved for system)
globalDefault: false
description: "Priority class for RabbitMQ to prevent eviction"
```

#### 2. Configure RabbitMQ Pod Resources

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq
spec:
  priorityClassName: rabbitmq-critical
  containers:
  - name: rabbitmq
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "2Gi"    # Set based on your observed usage
        cpu: "1000m"     # 1 full CPU core
      limits:
        memory: "4Gi"    # Allow headroom for spikes
        cpu: "2000m"     # Allow burst capacity
```

#### 3. Add PodDisruptionBudget

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2  # For clustered RabbitMQ
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: rabbitmq
```

### How This Ensures RabbitMQ is Last to be Evicted

1. **PriorityClass**: Kubernetes evicts lower-priority pods first during resource pressure
2. **Resource Requests**: Guarantees RabbitMQ gets its requested resources
3. **Resource Limits**: Prevents RabbitMQ from being OOMKilled unnecessarily
4. **PodDisruptionBudget**: Prevents voluntary disruptions during maintenance

- Update existing deployments with appropriate resource requests/limits

---

## 7. AI-Enhanced Insights

### Strategic Analysis

Based on the cluster data, I've identified several critical areas requiring immediate attention:

**Immediate Priorities (Week 1)**:
1. Address the 125 containers missing resource definitions, starting with the Critical risk namespaces (asu, cgh, jfk)
2. Implement LimitRange policies in all application namespaces to prevent future resource gaps
3. Increase memory limits for pods experiencing OOM events (8 instances identified)

**Short-term Actions (Weeks 2-4)**:
1. Configure RabbitMQ with priority class and PodDisruptionBudget to ensure messaging stability
2. Rebalance workloads across node pools - 3 nodes are running at >80% capacity
3. Implement ResourceQuota policies per namespace to cap overall resource consumption

**Long-term Improvements (Months 2-3)**:
1. Deploy Vertical Pod Autoscaler to automatically recommend and apply resource values
2. Set up continuous monitoring for resource utilization trends
3. Optimize short-lived jobs (71% of jobs complete in <2 minutes) - consider job batching

**Risk Assessment**: The cluster is in a DEGRADED state primarily due to missing resource definitions. This creates unpredictable scheduling behavior and increases the risk of cascading failures during high load. The 8 recent OOM events indicate memory pressure that could impact critical services.

### Enhanced Recommendations

- Establish a Resource Governance Policy requiring all deployments to specify requests/limits
- Use admission controllers (OPA/Gatekeeper) to enforce resource requirements
- Implement namespace-level quotas based on team/application criticality
- Set up automated alerts for pods nearing their memory/CPU limits

### Automation Suggestions

- Implement ResourceQuota policies
- Set up LimitRange defaults for namespaces
- Configure PodDisruptionBudgets for critical workloads
- Use Vertical Pod Autoscaler for dynamic resource recommendations
- Deploy Goldilocks for right-sizing recommendations
